# Rhino Flow Based Plugins

This sample project is a work in progress with the final aim of creating a starter project for a flow based plugin using Rhino 6 C++ SDK.

A flow based plugin can be defined as a plugin with a stipulated number of steps where each step represents a Rhino command.

### Projects

- [Moose by Dale Fugier](https://github.com/dalefugier/Moose/) : Especially the [MooseCoreLib](https://github.com/dalefugier/Moose/tree/6/MooseCoreLib) was quite useful as a hint project to setup the Google Test environment for the Sample Flow plugin without using the Rhino executable.
